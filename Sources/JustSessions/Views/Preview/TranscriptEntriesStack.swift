/// Every loaded entry is laid out, rather than only those near the viewport: the reader keeps only a few pages, at
/// most `TranscriptPagingModel.maximumRetainedPageCount`. A lazy stack estimates the heights of rows it has not laid out
/// and corrects them as they appear. That made scrolling jump, most of all past tall images, and the stack could
/// keep correcting without end inside one update, freezing the window, with images or with text alone.
///
/// Laying out every entry is costly, so the entries are their own view, compared by their inputs. These stay the same
/// while you scroll or search, so SwiftUI leaves the entries, and their layout, alone. Each entry's `id` lets
/// `ScrollViewProxy.scrollTo` bring it into view; nothing asks SwiftUI to track which one is at the top. A bookmark's
/// letter is an overlay reading only `transcriptBookmarkLetters`.
