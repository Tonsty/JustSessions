/// Tells a tab what a Claude Code on an SSH host does. Claude Code writes that only in its live process registry on the
/// host, `~/.claude/sessions/<pid>.json` (see `ClaudeLiveSessionRecord`), and its terminal title stays `✳ <topic>`
/// through a turn. So a tab's tmux session starts this relay beside the CLI. Once a second it reads the record whose
/// `tmux` entry names the relay's pane, as `<session>:<window id>.<pane id>`, and when its `status` or `waitingFor`
/// changes, sets them as the window option the session's title shows; see `RemoteCLIActivityTitle`. tmux passes
/// that title on to the tab over the tab's own connection, as it passes Codex's.
///
/// The pane's login shell starts it before the CLI, so it sees a `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` the host's startup files set. It
/// runs in `sh`, as that shell may be fish. It starts once with the pane and ends with the pane's process, so it goes
/// on while no tab is attached, and a tab that reattaches starts no second one. It waits one second between reads,
/// reads the record, one line of JSON, with the shell's own `read`, and looks for it again only while it is missing, as
/// before Claude Code writes it. A record cut short, as one read while Claude Code writes it, leaves the last activity.
///
/// It also relays the registry record and the latest explicit custom-title line in the session's transcript, for
/// `/rename` and `/clear`; see `RemoteClaudeSessionTitle`. Base64 keeps arbitrary names out of shell commands and tmux
/// formats. No new SSH command or dependency on Python is needed. The transcript is found only until it exists, and
/// only its last 64 KiB are read when its size changes; the last title is kept across turns but not session switches.
///
/// A window option works in tmux before 3.0, which has no pane options, and tmux 3.0 and later redraw the title when it
/// changes, as they don't for a session option. `refresh-client -S` makes tmux before 2.6 redraw it too.
