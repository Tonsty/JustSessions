/// Tells a tab what a Kiro CLI on an SSH host does. Kiro marks a turn under way only in its turn-markers folder on the
/// host (see `KiroTurnMarkers`), and its terminal title says nothing of it. So a tab's tmux session starts this relay
/// beside the CLI, as Claude Code's (`RemoteClaudeActivityRelay`). Once a second it lists the markers, and when one
/// names a process at or below the relay's pane, the CLI is working; otherwise it is idle. When that changes, it sets
/// it as the window option the session's title shows; see `RemoteCLIActivityTitle`. Without the folder, as from a Kiro
/// too old to keep one, it sets nothing, so the tab tells nothing rather than seeming idle.
///
/// The pane's login shell starts it before the CLI, so it sees an `XDG_DATA_HOME` the host's startup files set. It runs
/// in `sh`, as that shell may be fish. It starts once with the pane and ends with the pane's process, so it goes on
/// while no tab is attached, and a tab that reattaches starts no second one. Between reads it costs one `sleep`, and
/// while a marker exists, one `ps` of every process, read by `awk` up each marker's parents; `ps -A -o pid= -o ppid=`
/// lists them on Linux, macOS, and BusyBox.
