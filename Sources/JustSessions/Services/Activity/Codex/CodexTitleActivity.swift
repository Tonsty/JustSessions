/// Codex 0.128 or later waits for your approval or answer, the title starts `[ ! ] Action Required` instead,
/// alternating each second with `[ . ] Action Required`. Items are joined with ` | `, and `●` comes first while Codex
/// listens to the microphone; see codex-rs `tui/src/chatwidget/status_surfaces.rs`.

/// The title reaches the tab on this Mac and on an SSH host alike, so this is how the app knows what a Codex on a
/// host does. On this Mac it also tells waits that Codex's background server can't, since Codex started with `-c`
