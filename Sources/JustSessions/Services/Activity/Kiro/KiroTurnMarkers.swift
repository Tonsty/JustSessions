/// The turns Kiro CLI has under way, as it marks them itself. While a turn runs, Kiro's TUI keeps
/// `<data folder>/kiro-cli/run/turn-markers/<pid>-<turn start in ms>.json`, and takes it away when the turn ends,
/// also within a second of Ctrl-C or Esc cancelling it, which no `Stop` hook reports. It does so under both its V2 and
/// V3 engines. The data folder is `~/Library/Application Support` on macOS and `${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}` on
/// Linux. The pid is the TUI's, below the `kiro-cli` and `kiro-cli-chat chat` processes a tab starts, so a tab's CLI
/// is matched by its process tree, as Claude Code's wrapper scripts are.
///
/// The folder is undocumented: Kiro CLI 2.31.1 keeps it, and 2.16.2 doesn't. A Kiro too old to keep one tells
/// nothing, rather than seeming idle. Kiro marks nothing while it asks for permission, so that reads as working.
