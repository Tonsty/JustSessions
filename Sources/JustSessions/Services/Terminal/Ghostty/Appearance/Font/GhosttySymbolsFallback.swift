/// Draws the Nerd Font icons the terminal font lacks with the bundled symbols font, as SwiftTerm does; see
/// `TerminalSymbolsFont`. Ghostty takes a character the terminal font lacks from the first fallback family that has it,
/// and a few of the families from `CoreTextFallbackFamilies` have glyphs of their own at icons' codepoints: Hiragino
/// Sans GB draws some Devicons as letters, STIX Two Math draws U+E0A0, Powerline's branch icon, as a diagonal line, and
/// Kefa draws some Octicons as fractions. So the symbols font joins the fallback families just ahead of the first such
/// family, and the families before it keep every character they draw. Characters the terminal font has keep its
/// glyphs, and Ghostty still draws the Powerline separators itself, ahead of any font.
///
/// The symbols font also has a few characters outside the Private Use Areas, such as the power symbols from U+23FB,
/// which SwiftTerm draws with the system's usual fallback. Those that a family after the symbols font drew go back to
/// that family through `font-codepoint-map`, which Ghostty applies before looking in the fallback families.
///
/// System Monospaced gets the symbols font too. SwiftTerm can't give it one, but Ghostty drew icons for it anyway from
/// its own copy of the font, which it tries after the configured families.
